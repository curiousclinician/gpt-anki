" What is the importance of parallelism in modern applications?", "Modern applications require a high degree of parallelism to handle complex user interfaces and faster machines." 
"What are threads used for in Java programming?", "Threads provide efficient multiprocessing and distribution of tasks for both client and server applications."
"How does Java support synchronization between threads accessing resources?", "Java supports synchronization based on the monitor and condition model, using the keyword synchronized to designate methods or blocks of code that need safe access within an object."
"Does Java have any built-in utilities addressing common patterns in multithreaded programming? If so, what are they called?" ,  "Yes. The high-level concurrency package provides powerful utilities such as thread pools, coordination of tasks, sophisticated locking etc."
"Why should developers learn how to program with threads even if some may never write multithreaded code?",  "Learning how to program with threads is an important part mastering programming skills in Java which all developers should grasp"
"What do packages offer over classes at a higher level structure?" ,"Packages group classes into functional units providing naming convention for organizing them along with organizational control over visibility variables & methods "
"How can packages help design scalable application without becoming tightly coupled codes nest ?",   ", Packages lend themselves well towards building reusable components working together systematically while keeping scalability issues under check."
